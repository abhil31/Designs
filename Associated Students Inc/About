I am proud to be part of the Associated Students Inc. (ASI) at California State University, East Bay , where I began my journey as a Junior Assistant in the ASI Marketing Team. Through dedication, creativity, and a passion for impactful storytelling, I was later promoted to a Senior Member/Designer within the same team—a role that has allowed me to contribute significantly to the organization’s mission of enhancing student life and engagement.

In my current position as a Senior Designer , I lead the creation of compelling marketing content that resonates with our diverse student body. From designing eye-catching visuals to crafting engaging social media campaigns, I ensure that every piece of content aligns with ASI’s goals and values while fostering a strong connection with the campus community.

My responsibilities also extend beyond design. As an integral member of the marketing team, I actively participate in planning and executing marketing activities that promote ASI events, programs, and initiatives. Whether it’s organizing outreach efforts, managing promotional materials, or collaborating with other departments, I strive to deliver strategies that drive participation and amplify ASI’s presence on campus.

Additionally, I play a key role in strategic planning , helping shape the overall direction of ASI’s marketing efforts. By analyzing trends, identifying target audiences, and setting measurable objectives, I help ensure that our campaigns are not only creative but also data-driven and results-oriented. This involves brainstorming innovative ideas, conducting feedback sessions, and continuously refining our approach to meet the evolving needs of students.

Joining ASI as a Junior Assistant was the starting point of an incredible journey filled with growth, learning, and meaningful contributions. Being promoted to Senior Designer is a testament to my commitment to excellence and my ability to adapt and excel in dynamic environments. It has been an honor to serve the students of Cal State East Bay through thoughtful, impactful, and inclusive marketing initiatives—and I look forward to continuing this work in the years to come.
